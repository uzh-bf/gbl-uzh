          Game-based learning has many benefits for lecturers and students.
          However, it can be difficult to get started with developing learning
          games and integrating games with other curricular activities. We want
          to foster the application of game-based learning in the university
          context by providing foundational resources for game usage and
          development based on what we have learned on our own journey.
