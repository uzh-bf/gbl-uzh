keyTakeawayList:
    - "Game-Based Learning is a growing field of interest with a
    potential of supporting teaching, improving learning, and making
    the entire learning process more engaging."
    - "Simulations and serious games can be used for such educational
    purposes. Whereas simulations represent a simplified real life
    situation, serious games can be realistic but also seek to
    educate in a more entertaining manner."
    - "Game-Based Learning works because content is learned and
    retained more easily due to improved engagement with the
    learning matter and because intrinsic motivation is fostered by
    the gamified approach."
