    "Before starting with the actual game development, it is necessary to
    evaluate which topics are suitable and useful for an implementation in
    the form of game-based learning. Game-based learning is a form of
    teaching and learning that can be particularly motivating and
    sustainable. However, it is recommended to conduct a cost-benefit
    analysis before making the actual development decision. The
    implementation of complex content in a playable form requires a
    considerable amount of resources in terms of content and technology."

    - "Evaluate first whether a learning game is a good fit for your problem,
    as other teaching methods can work better depending on your use case."
    - "Involve potential users in the idea generation process to get a broader perspective."
    - "Ensure that the knowledge level of the potential users and the learning goals of your game match well."
