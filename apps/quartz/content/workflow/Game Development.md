    "After the decision to implement a particular game idea, the actual
    game development takes place. A loop-like approach involving the
    content and technical developers is recommended. Individual game
    elements should be tested and evaluated on an ongoing basis so that
    corrective measures can be taken promptly if necessary."

keyTakeawayList:
    - "Let potential users test your game regularly throughout the development process.
    Organize small testing sessions with a few participants to evaluate interactions."
    - "Evaluate testing sessions with user-centered approaches to investigate the player
    workflow and potential usability issues. Investigate how players approach and reach
    their learning objectives during play."
    - "Focus on your prioritized development goals and keep a wish list for further development.
    Ensure that what is built is of high quality and fits together well."
