description:
    "When a game (part) is ready to play, it should be implemented in a
    suitable learning setting. Necessary theories and teaching materials
    should be taught at appropriate points before, during or after the
    game itself. Whether in the virtual or physical classroom - a
    didactically sound embedding in the flow of the lesson is important
    for a sustainable learning success of the participants. In order to
    find a suitable game setting and to further develop the game (part),
    it is helpful to always ask for feedback and to regularly evaluate the
    game and the game setting."

    - "Ensure that the students have the relevant theoretical background before they play the game
    (e.g., provide prerequisites, readings, or an introductory session)."
    - "Prepare a sound didactical concept that embes the game into your course or similar setting."
    - "Provide regular feedback to the players so that they can continuously improve their knowledge throughout the
    game."
