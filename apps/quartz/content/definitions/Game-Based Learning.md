## What is Game-Based Learning?

![[Gamification Circle.png]]

(Digital) Game-Based Learning describes „any marriage of educational content and computer games“ ([[Prensky (2007, p. 145)]]). As such, the game becomes the training. Important game types are: [[Serious Games]] and [[Simulations]].

## Why is Game-Based Learning useful?
- **Experience as main driver for learning**: According to learning scientists experience is an important factor of learning: “If you do it, you learn it”. This can be obtained by applying serious games and simulations.

- **Immediate feedback**: [[Serious Games]] and [[Simulations]] provide players with current feedback on their actions. They allow players to test different behaviours and strategies and experience possible implications ([[Christen and Katsarov (2018)]]).

- **Learning effects**: Numerous meta-analyses show superior learning outcomes when learning with [[definitions/Serious Games]] and [[Simulations]] compared to traditional learning techniques ([[Sailer and Homner (2020)]]).

- **Safe environment**: [[definitions/Serious Games]] and [[Simulations]] enable a risk-free learning environment. This allows for players to make mistakes and to derive valuable learning experiences from these ([[Fox, Pittaway, and Uzuegbunam (2018)]]).

## How does Game-Based Learning work?
Effects paths of [[definitions/Serious Games]] and [[Simulations]] ([[Mayer (2011)]]; [[Wouters et al. (2013)]]):
-   **Cognitive path**: Enhanced cognitive activation and versatile approach to learning content
-   **Motivational path**: Promotion of intrinsic motivation, leading to longer and more intensive engagement with learning content
    
Effects ([[Mayer (2011)]]; [[Wouters et al. (2013)]]):
-   **Cognitive effects**: Increased acquisition of declarative and procedural knowledge
-   **Motivational effects**: Increased interest and target focus, experience of one's own competences, satisfaction of motivational needs
