The Bloom Taxonomy is a taxonomy of educational objectives. It serves as a framework to classify statements about the expected learning as a result of instructions. The taxonomy is depicted as a hierarchy of six major categories of the cognitive process. The categories differ in their complexity with increasing complexity the higher the category is rated. The Bloom Taxonomy is also applicable to [[Microlearning]].

The individual categories are briefly outlined below. Their corresponding cognitive processes are itemised in **bold** and described. Alternative names or synonyms of the processes are *italicised*.

## Remember
In the "Remember" category, the focus lies on identifying and retrieving relevant knowledge from memory and on the retention of learned materials. Its associated cognitive processes are "Recognizing" and "Recalling".
- **Recognizing** refers to *identifying* knowledge and locating it in one's memory.
- **Recalling** is the process of *retrieving* knowledge from memory.

## Understand
The "Understand" category refers to determining the meaning of instructional messages and communication of all sorts (oral, written and graphic). The following cognitive processes are related to "Understand":
- **Interpreting** is connotated with *clarifying*, *paraphrasing*, *representing*, or *translating* some communication. It is applied when changing from one form of representation to another like paraphrasing a speech.
- Within **Exemplifying**, the idea is to find examples for a concept or priciple. This can be done through *illustrating* and *instantiating*.
- To determining the category of something, *categorizing* or *subsuming* outline the cognitive process of **Classifying**.
- **Summarizing** is associated with the *abstracting* and *generalizing* a theme of major points.
- **Inferring** describes drawing logical conclusions form information and comprises the processes of *concluding*, *extrapolating*, *interpolating* or *predicting*.
- **Comparing** entails the juxtaposition of two ideas, objects or the like and is outlined through *contrasting*, *mapping* and *matching*.
- **Explaining** refers to the *construction of a model* of a system for example a model to describe causes and their effects.

## Apply
Within the "Apply" category, the learning aims at the ability to carry out or use a procedure in a given situation. Thereby, it is differentiated between familiar and unfamiliar situations.
- Applying a procedure to a familiar task or *carrying out* a familiar task is referred to as **Executing**.
- **Implementing** consequently is associated with *using* a known concept to solve an unfamiliar task.

## Analyse
Breaking up material into its constituent parts in order to determine how the individual parts relate to the overall concept and to one another is what makes the content of the "Analyse" category. It contains the following three cognitive processes:
- **Differentiating** is associated with *discriminating*, *distinguishing*, *focusing*, and *selecting*. It refers to the process of separating material into relevant and irrelevant parts.
- The process of **Organizing** is implemented through *finding coherence*, *integrating*, *outlining*, *parsing*, and *structuring*. Its purpose it to determine how individual elements affect the bigger structure.
- **Attributing** characterizes the process of *deconstructing* in order to grasp a point of view, bias, or intent of a graph or essay.

## Evaluate
The "Evaluate" category is described by forming judgements based on standards and criteria on a topic. The processes differ based on whether they are concerned with the internal or external consistency of, for example, a product.
- Detecting internal (in-)consistencies of a procedure or product and their effectiveness upon implementation can be conducted through *coordinating*, *detecting*, *monitoring*, and *testing*. This internal process is known as **Checking**.
- Contrarily, **Critiquing** refers to detecting external (in-)consistencies of a procedure or product. Also *judging* whether a procedure is appropriate for a given situation falls into this process.

## Create
"Create" represents the most complex category. Its goal is the ability to combine or rearrange pieces and elements to form a coherent or functional (new) whole. 
- Within **Generating**, the idea is to come up with alternative hypotheses given certain criteria. The process is also called *hypothesizing*.
- *Designing* a procedure to fullfil a specific task outline the **Planning** process.
- **Producing** entails *constructing* or inventing new products or procedures.
