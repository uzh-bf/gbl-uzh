[[Bartle (1996)]] categorizes the nature of players into four types:

## Achievers:
Around 10% of players belong to the Achiever type. They are motivated by in-game rewards and achieving measurable goals.

## Explorers:
Another 10% of players make up the Explorer type. Explorers enjoy exploring the game world, discovering hidden secrets, and solving puzzles.

## Socialisers:
The largest part of players, around 80%, identify as Socialisers. They value social interaction and relationships with other players more than other aspects of the game.

## Killers:
Only a small fraction of players are a part of the Killer type (<1 %). Killers enjoy the competition and conflict with other players, often experienced through direct combat or confrontation.
