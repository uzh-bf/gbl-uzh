## What is a Serious Game?
A serious game „is a game in which education (in its various forms) is the primary goal, rather than entertainment“ ([[Michael and Chen (2006, p. 17)]]). Although the learning outcome is key, these games are usually also measured by their entertainment value. As such, they allow a liberal approach to complexity reduction ([[Breuer (2010)]]).
