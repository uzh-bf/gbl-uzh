[[definitions/Serious Games|Serious Games]] are focused on the game experience to foster experiential learning. Therefore, these games are often more similar to games made for entertainment, especially in terms of visual fidelity and storytelling. Game engines made for traditional games can be very useful when trying to build a serious game, as they abstract away a lot of the lower level coding.
