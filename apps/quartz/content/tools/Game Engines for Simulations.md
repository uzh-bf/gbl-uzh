[[Simulations]] are a somewhat realistic representation of a real-world phenomenon. Packaging these phenomena in a learning game context can make them more applicable and intuitive to understand. 

[[Simulations]] often consist of considerable amounts of data processing and mathematical computations. Such computations can be abstracted into [[Game Models]]. [[Game Models]] can interact and yield a game state, a representation of the game at a given point in time.

## Periods
In our [[Simulations]], there are almost always multiple periods in a single game. The simulation is played by the participants during a period, their decisions arecollected once a period is closing, and a new game state is computed by running the relevant [[Game Models]]. The new game state can then be evaluated and  discussed with the participants to foster their learning experience.

## Simulation Platform
We plan to develop a technical framework in the form of a [[GBL Simulation Platform]] that will provide the basic functionalities described above, and allows you to focus on building the [[Game Models]] and [[Game Decisions]] based on your [[Learning Objectives]].
