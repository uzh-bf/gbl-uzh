## Paper's Abstract
In this paper we focus on the interaction design properties of micro-
learning experiences to outline relevant research directions and main challenges
of the field. We start by analyzing current efforts in the area of educational
technologies in terms of their support of anytime-anywhere access to learning
resources, which is a core property of microlearning environments. We also
overview learning theories that are relevant to address the lifelong dimension of
informal everyday activities of knowledge acquisition. From this discussion a
set of design requirements and evaluation issues are derived to inform future
investigation and experimentations in the microlearning area.
