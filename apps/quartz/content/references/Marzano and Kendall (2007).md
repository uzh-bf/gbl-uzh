## Summary
"The New Taxonomy of Educational Objectives" by Robert J. Marzano and John S. Kendall presents a revised framework for categorizing educational goals and objectives. Building upon Bloom's well-known taxonomy, Marzano's new model restructures thinking skills into a hierarchy that ranges from retrieval and comprehension at the base to knowledge utilization at the top. The book argues for the integration of this model into curriculum and assessment design to better align with contemporary educational needs. It explores dimensions of knowledge, including information, mental procedures, and psychomotor procedures. The authors also discuss the roles of metacognitive system, which involves decision making and self-regulation, and the self-system, which influences students' motivation to engage with tasks. The revised taxonomy is intended to provide educators with a more detailed understanding of how to structure teaching and assessment to support student learning effectively.
