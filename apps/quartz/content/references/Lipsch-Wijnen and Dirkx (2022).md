## Paper's Abstract
Effective feedback is a powerful educational intervention to support
learning. Hattie and Timperley have developed a feedback model in which they
define three different functions and four different levels of feedback. Although the
model is widely used in educational practice, there is little known about how the
model is used in education nor about the optimal distribution of the different types
of feedback. In the current case study, we used an explanatory sequential mixed
method design to investigate how lecturers use the model and how its use can be
optimized. For this, 349 feedback comments from 22 lecturers were analysed, and 5
feedback experts participated in a focus group interview. The results show that
most of the feedback given by the lecturers is task-oriented feedback and that
current feedback practices can be improved by focusing more on the combination of
feedup, feedback, and feedforward. In addition, results indicate that the level (task,
process, self-regulation, person) of the feedback is more difficult to determine
beforehand and should be tailored to the learning goal. The design of the assessment
form plays an important role in this alignment.
