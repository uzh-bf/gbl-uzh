# Formative assessment and the design of instructional systems

## Summary
[[Formative assessment]] is a process that evaluates student responses to improve their [[competence]] and [[learning outcomes]]. It is most effective when it includes [[feedback]] that is used to make adjustments in teaching and learning activities. Unlike [[summative assessment]], which summarizes student achievement at the end of a course, [[formative assessment]] is ongoing and interactive, involving both teachers and students in a dialogue about [[learning progress]]. For [[formative assessment]] to be effective, it requires clear [[learning goals]], understanding of where students currently are in their [[learning journey]], and strategies to close the [[learning gap]]. The article discusses the nature and function of [[formative assessment]] in instructional systems, emphasizing the importance of students developing the capacity to monitor the quality of their own work and the need for [[instructional systems]] to provide opportunities for acquiring [[evaluative expertise]].
## Key Topics
- **Formative Assessment in Instructional Systems:** [[Formative assessment]] applies to [[learning outcomes]] assessed qualitatively using multiple criteria. It is designed to shape and improve student [[competence]] by providing [[feedback]] and enabling [[self-monitoring]] during the [[learning process]].
- **Feedback and Self-Monitoring:** [[Feedback]] is crucial in [[formative assessment]], defined as information about the gap between actual and [[reference levels]] of a system parameter used to alter the gap. Effective [[feedback]] involves the teacher and student in a dialogue that informs teaching and learning decisions.
- **Qualitative Judgments:** Qualitative judgments are direct appraisals made by a person, involving multiple, often interlocking criteria. They are essential in assessing complex [[learning outcomes]] and require a deep understanding of the criteria used for appraisal.
- **Learning Progression and Teaching Adjustments:** [[Formative assessment]] is linked to [[learning progression]]s that articulate subgoals toward ultimate [[learning goals]]. It helps teachers locate where students are in their learning and adjust instruction to help students progress.
- **Summative vs. Formative Assessment:** [[Summative assessment]] summarizes student achievement status for reporting purposes, while [[formative assessment]] is concerned with using judgments about student responses to improve learning and is not necessarily tied to the timing of instruction.
## Abstract
> The main aim of gamification, i.e. the implementation of game design elements in real-world contexts for non-gaming purposes, is to foster human motivation and performance in regard to a given activity. Previous research, although not entirely conclusive, generally supports the hypothesis underlying this aim. However, previous studies have often treated gamification as a generic construct, neglecting the fact that there are many different game design elements which can result in very diverse applications. Based on a self-determination theory framework, we present the results of a randomized controlled study that used an online simulation environment. We deliberately varied different configurations of game design elements, and analysed them in regard to their effect on the fulfilment of basic psychological needs. Our results show that badges, leaderboards, and performance graphs positively affect competence need satisfaction, as well as perceived task meaningfulness, while avatars, meaningful stories, and teammates affect experiences of social relatedness. Perceived decision freedom, however, could not be affected as intended. We interpret these findings as general support for our main hypothesis that gamification is not effective per se, but that specific game design elements have specific psychological effects. Consequences for further research, in particular the importance of treatment checks, are discussed.
