## Summary
The paper synthesizes the literature on the application of [[gamification]] in educational contexts. The authors conducted a comprehensive review to identify [[game design elements]] used in education and their impact on [[learning outcomes|learner outcomes]]. They found that elements such as [[points]], [[levels]], [[badges]], [[leaderboards]], and [[storylines]] are commonly used to enhance learner [[engagement]] and improve [[learning outcomes]]. The paper provides examples from various studies that illustrate the application and effects of these [[gamification]] elements. While some studies reported positive effects on [[engagement]] and [[participation]], others did not find significant improvements in grades or interest. The paper concludes that [[gamification]] in education is growing in popularity, but systematic studies to evaluate its impact are still in the early stages.
## Key Topics
- **[[Gamification]] in Education:** The application of [[game design elements]] to non-game educational activities to increase [[engagement]] and improve [[learning outcomes]].
- **[[Game Design Elements]]:** Tools such as [[points]], [[levels]], [[badges]], and [[leaderboards]] used within gamified educational environments to motivate and engage learners.
- **[[learning outcomes|Learner Outcomes]]:** The impact of [[gamification]] on aspects such as [[engagement]], [[motivation]], [[enjoyment]], and academic [[performance]].
- **Literature Review:** A synthesis of existing research on [[gamification]] in education, summarizing the use of various [[game design elements]] and their effects on [[learning]].
- **Evaluation of [[Gamification]]:** The need for systematic evaluations using scientific approaches to assess the impact of [[gamification]] on education.
## Abstract
> We synthesized the literature on gamification of education by conducting a review of the literature on gamification in the educational and learning context. Based on our review, we identified several game design elements that are used in education. These game design elements include points, levels/stages, badges, leaderboards, prizes, progress bars, storyline, and feed- back. We provided examples from the literature to illustrate the application of gamification in the educational context.
