## Summary
"Visible Learning for Teachers" by John Hattie synthesizes research in the field of education to provide insights on effective teaching practices. The book compiles evidence from numerous studies to evaluate the impact of different teaching interventions on student learning. Hattie introduces the concept of "visible learning," which emphasizes the importance of teachers seeing learning through the eyes of students and students becoming their own teachers. The book provides strategies for educators to apply this concept in the classroom by focusing on the most impactful teaching practices. Hattie's work underscores the value of teacher clarity, feedback, and the active involvement of students in the learning process. By doing so, it offers a framework for educators to enhance teaching effectiveness and improve educational outcomes.
