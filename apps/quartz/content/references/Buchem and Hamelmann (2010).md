## Summary
In this paper we introduce microlearning in online communities as a learning approach
triggered by current patterns of media use and supported by new technologies, such as Web 2.0 and social software. We delineate microlearning as a "pragmatic innovation" to lifelong learning
due to its capability to support flexible learning that can be easily integrated into everyday
activities, supporting individual learning aims and needs.

First, we explore the concepts of microcontent and microlearning in the context of Web 2.0,
social software, eLearning 2.0, personal learning environments, and informal and work-based
learning, observing its innovative approaches to lifelong learning and reflecting the needs of
current web users. We then identify underlying design principles and distinguish two main
aspects of didactical design, i.e. (1) design of microcontent and (2) design of microlearning
activities. We continue by presenting the ten key features that we identified to help distinguish
microlearning from more traditional eLearning formats, such as web-based trainings, termed
"macrolearning".

Following this overview, we illustrate how microlearning can contribute to lifelong learning by
bridging the gap between formal and informal learning and present a case study of a
microlearning scenario. We argue that microcontent and microlearning, enhanced by Web 2.0,
provide a viable solution to fast-paced and multitask-oriented patterns of learning and working
today. Microlearning, aligned with formal learning and embedded in online communities, has
the potential to support ongoing professional development.
