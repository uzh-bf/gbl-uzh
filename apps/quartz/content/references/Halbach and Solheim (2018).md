## Paper's Abstract
This work investigates in how far gamification and micro-learning, implemented by the novel technologies H5P and xAPI, are suitable to increase the motivation and learning performance of pupils with cognitive and behavioral challenges. The context for the field trials is the Norwegian SOL framework (short for Systematic Observation of Reading) in 6th and 7th grade. The results show that, albeit there are technical deficiencies, the technology is well suited for crafting engaging learning experiences. The prototype developed in the course of the project is capable of assessing task fidelity and pupil performance. With the proper statistical analysis, it can be a valuable ingredient for useful teacher assets such as monitoring tools.
