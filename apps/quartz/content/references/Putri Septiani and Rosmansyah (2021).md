# Features, Frameworks, and Benefits of Gamified Microlearning: A Systematic Literature Review
## Summary
The study explores the integration of [[gamification]] and [[microlearning]] to enhance learning experiences. Utilizing a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, the research sifted through 24,689 articles from reputable databases, narrowing down to 20 relevant studies. The findings reveal 15 key features of gamified [[microlearning]] categorized into game environment, learning content, assessment, and user control. Additionally, seven frameworks for developing gamified [[microlearning]] platforms were identified, alongside seven benefits highlighting increased [[motivation]] and [[engagement]] among learners. The study underscores the effectiveness of gamified [[microlearning]] in creating enjoyable and efficient [[learning environments]].
## Key Topics
- **Gamified [[Microlearning]] Features:** Identified 15 features across four categories—game environment, learning content, assessment, and user control—essential for engaging and effective learning platforms.
- **Frameworks for Gamified [[Microlearning]]:** Seven frameworks were discussed, including the [[Octalysis Framework]] and the [[Snowflake Model]], which guide the development of gamified [[microlearning]] platforms by integrating [[game elements]] with educational content.
- **Benefits of Gamified [[Microlearning]]:** The study highlights seven benefits, such as increased [[motivation]], [[engagement]], and efficient learning, demonstrating the positive impact of gamified [[microlearning]] on the [[learning process]].
## Abstract
> Gamified microlearning, as an approach that collaborates microlearning and gamification theory is widely adopted nowadays. Users report positive feedback on its utilization in various sectors. This paper provides a review of previous and current research to synthesize theory about gamified microlearning, including features, framework, and gamified microlearning benefits by using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as a method. Reputable journal databases included ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDi- rect, ProQuest, and Scopus were discovered to conduct the SLR. As many as 24.689 articles were found by specific keywords and filtered to 20 eligible articles with good quality and high relevance with gamified microlearning research. This study found 15 main features of gamified microlearning in four main categories, seven frameworks used to develop gamified microlearning platforms, and seven interesting benefits of using gamified microlearning in several various sectors. From the SLR conducted, the use of a gamified microlearning platform in the learning process has increased the motivation and engaged students to learn. It also motivates students to voluntarily contribute to learning and support gamified microlearning because of its fun environment.
