# Does gamification improve student learning outcome? Evidence from a meta-analysis and synthesis of qualitative data in educational contexts
## Summary
This meta-analysis examined the effects of gamification on student academic performance in educational contexts. The authors analyzed 30 independent interventions from 24 quantitative studies comparing gamified vs non-gamified learning. They found an overall significant medium effect size (Hedges' g=0.504) in favor of gamification. Moderator analyses revealed no significant differences based on game element types, number of elements, or levels of research design control. However, effect sizes varied significantly with sample size and intervention duration. A qualitative synthesis of 32 studies identified reasons students like gamification (fosters enthusiasm, provides feedback, fulfills need for recognition, promotes goal-setting) and dislike it (lack of utility, causes anxiety/jealousy). The authors highlight the favorable impact of gamification on learning outcomes and suggest future research directions.
## Key Topics
- **Effects of gamification on academic performance:** The meta-analysis found an overall significant positive effect (g=0.504) of gamification on student learning outcomes compared to non-gamified instruction.
- **Moderator variables:** Analyses revealed effect sizes varied significantly with sample size (larger effects for n=50-100) and intervention duration (larger effects for 1-3 months), but not with game element types, number of elements, or research design controls.
- **Student perceptions of gamification:** Qualitative synthesis identified reasons students enjoy gamification (enthusiasm, feedback, recognition, goal-setting) and dislike it (lack of utility, anxiety/jealousy).
- **Theories underpinning gamification:** The authors discuss how theories like goal-setting, self-determination, social comparison, and operant conditioning can explain the motivational effects of various game elements.
- **Recommendations for future research:** Suggestions include examining the long-term effects of gamification, impacts of competition and collaboration, relationships between game elements and instructional content, and teachers' attitudes toward gamification.
## Abstract
> Despite the buzz around [gamification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/gamification "Learn more about gamification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as an exciting new method to engage students, evidence of its ability to enhance learning is mixed. In fact, [gamification](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/gamification "Learn more about gamification from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has attracted considerable controversy (“_gamification is bullshit_”) and some derogatory labels such as “_exploitationware._” Therefore, in order to make the case for or against gamification in education, it is important to examine the effects (if any) of gamification on student learning achievements. This study is a meta-analysis of 30 independent interventions (3,202 participants) drawn from 24 quantitative studies that have examined the effects of gamification on student [academic performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/academic-performance "Learn more about academic performance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in various educational settings. The results show an overall significant medium [effect size](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/size-effect "Learn more about effect size from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in favor of gamification over learning without gamification (Hedges' g = 0.504, 95% CI [0.284–0.723], p < 0.001). No publication bias is detected. An analysis of 32 [qualitative studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/qualitative-research "Learn more about qualitative studies from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") reveals four reasons for learners' enjoyment of gamification: (a) gamification can foster enthusiasm; (b) gamification can provide feedback on performance; (c) gamification can fulfill learners’ needs for recognition; and (d) gamification can promote goal setting, and two reasons for their dislike of gamification: (a) gamification does not bring additional utility and (b) gamification can cause anxiety or jealousy. We conclude by highlighting two unresolved questions, and suggesting several future research directions concerning gamification in educational contexts.
