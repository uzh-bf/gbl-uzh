Welcome to our [[Gamification]] and [[Game-Based Learning]] knowledge base. Our knowledge base contains the know how and best practices we have accumulated while developing games and simulations for our own teaching, as well as when implementing [[Gamification]] principles in our apps (e.g., the [[KlickerUZH]]).

To get started, check out one of the following resources:

- For a short guide on how this networked knowledge base works, see [[Getting Started]].
- To get an overview of the courses, games and simulations we have developed or are currently working on, see [[GBL in Use]].
- For the current planning and development progress of our projects, see [[Project]] and our updates in the [GBL Community](https://community.klicker.uzh.ch/c/gamification/gbl/10).
